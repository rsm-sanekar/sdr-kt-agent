# Install every skill in this repo into the project's .claude/skills/ folder
# so Claude Code (and other Anthropic-compatible agents) can load them.
#
# Auto-discovers any folder under skills/ that contains a SKILL.md file.
# For each one, creates a relative symlink at:
#
#   .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md   ->  ../../../skills/<name>/SKILL.md
#   .claude/skills/<name>/scripts    ->  ../../../skills/<name>/scripts
#
# Run from anywhere:
#
#   bash install.sh
#
# Re-run is safe — `ln -sfn` replaces existing symlinks in place.
# After install, restart Claude Code (or start a new session) to pick up
# the registered skills.
